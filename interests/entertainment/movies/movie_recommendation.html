                I really liked this movie and it was such an experience watching it in theaters.
                I would recommend this movie to pretty much anyone who likes watching both horror and mystery/suspensfull movies.
                Unlike most horror movies this movie doesn't soley rely on jumscares and gore to get the audience squirming in their seats.
                A lot of the horror scenes were well paced and had absolutely wonderful camera work that supplemented the actors and the characters they were playing.
                The VFX and SFX were also exceptional and easy to get sucked into.
                Also I mean come on, Willem Dafoe in a gothic horror movie? Like come on.
