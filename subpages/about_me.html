                Hi! My name is Victor Cavazos. I am majoring in computer science with a minor in cyber security.
                I am 20 years old and currently in my Junior year of college.

                    Some of my favorite hobbies are: video games, reading, working out, arts and crafts, and I've been meaning to get into gardening.
