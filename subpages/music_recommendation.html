                Here comes that feeling, you should never let it go<br>
                (Ca-), caress that feeling, that feeling in you<br>
                The flag is raised, baby, the glory's to the throne<br>
                It's just beginning, we winning-inning<br>
                There is no goal, only to walk the promised road<br>
                (I'm), I'm coming home, Virginia-inia<br>
                I'm but a shell, baby, the hero is the soul<br>
                (Keep), keep it within you, continue-inue<br>
                Suddenly, everything turns gold for me<br>
                Suffering isn't anymore, gold wash over me<br>
                Shining like the sun, nothing's ugly<br>
                White light cover me, in this world and her majesty<br>
                Number one in reality<br>
                Head of the fountain, head of the arrowhead<br>
                (Don't touch me, don't let them bait you)<br>
                Head of the fountain, head to the arrowhead<br>
                (Good looking, yeah, but pay attention)<br>
                Head of the fountain, head to the arrowhead<br>
                (Unconscious, I-I had to awaken)<br>
                Head of the fountain, head of the arrowhead<br>
                (La-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la)<br>
                She shines her light on me<br>
                Maria, Maria<br>
                She shines her light on me<br>
                Maria, Maria<br>
                Maria, Maria, Mari-, Maria, Maria<br>
                Caress the feeling, the feeling in you<br>
                Maria, Maria, Maria, Holy Gloria<br>
                Keep it within you, continue-inue<br>
                Maria, Maria, Mari-, Maria, Maria<br>
                (Never let it go)<br>
                Caress the feeling, the feeling in you<br>
                Maria, Maria, Maria, Holy Gloria<br>
                (The hero is the soul)<br>
                Keep it within you, continue-inue<br>
                Head of the fountain, head of the arrowhead<br>
                (Caress the feeling, uh)<br>
                Don't touch me<br>
                (Keep it within you, continue-inue)<br>
                Head of the fountain, head of the arrowhead<br>
                (Maria, Maria, Mari-, Maria, Maria)<br>
                Head of the fountain, head to the arrowhead<br>
                (Maria, Maria, Maria, Holy Gloria)<br>
                Head of the fountain, head to the arrowhead<br>
                (Maria, Maria, Mari-, Maria, Maria)<br>
                Head of the fountain, head of the arrowhead<br>
                (Maria, Maria, Maria, Holy Gloria)<br>
                Here comes that feeling, you should never let it go (go, go)<br>
                Hahaha, that feeling in you (yeah)<br>
                The-the-, the flag is raised, baby, the glory's to the throne<br>
